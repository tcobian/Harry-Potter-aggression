## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

1. Load packages and the data set
```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
hp_data<- read_csv("harry_potter_aggression_full.csv")


```

2. Do some basic wrangling and make a graph of Draco and Harry aggression rates

```{r}
hp_graph<- hp_data %>% 
  filter(Name == "Harry" | Name == "Draco Malfoy") %>% 
  select(Name, book, agg.per.mention) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = book, y = agg.per.mention))+
  geom_col(aes(fill = Name), position = "dodge")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw()

hp_graph

```

Draco is a douche
